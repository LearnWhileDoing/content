*Sets* a common way to store a collection of values in Dart. Sets are unordered, and each item must be unique.

```
|---------|---------|---------|
|  "hey"  | "hello" | "howdy" |
|---------|---------|---------|
```

Above is a graphical representation of a set. We call a value in a set an "element".

# Creating a set

Now that we know what a set is, how do we make one? Here are 5 different ways to create sets:

```java
Set set1 = {};
var set2 = Set();
var set3 = {1, 2};
var set4 = <int>{};
```

In `set1` and `set2`, we create a dynamic set. There is no boundary on either the type or size of the set. In `set1`, the set is created using what is known as a *collection literal* because instead of writing out the full class initialization like we do in `set2`, we simply use braces `{}` to tell Dart that this variable is a set.

If you use the collection literal for sets, you must specify that the type of the variable is indeed `Set` in the initialization of the variable. This is because the collection literal of sets are the same for maps, and if you don't specify if the variable is a set or a map, Dart won't be able to tell.

In `set3` and `set4`, we create a typed set. This means that we can only add values of a specific type to the set. In `set3`, we initialize the set with two integer values; from those values, Dart can *infer* that the set will be a typed list for integer values. In `set4`, we add a *generic* (that's the `<int>`) in front of the collection literal initialization, which tells Dart that this list is a typed set for integer values.

# Common operations

## Add a value

There are two ways to add a value to a set:

```java
list.add("hi"); // using the add method
list += "hi"; // using the + operator

/* Before addition:
|---------|---------|---------|
|  "hey"  | "hello" | "howdy" |
|---------|---------|---------|

After addition:
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|  "hey"  | "hello" | "howdy" |   "hi"  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
*/

// What happens when we add a value that is already in the set?

list += "hi";

/* Before addition:
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|  "hey"  | "hello" | "howdy" |   "hi"  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|

After addition:
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|  "hey"  | "hello" | "howdy" |   "hi"  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
*/
```

## Remove a value

To remove a value in the list, we use the `remove` method like so:

```java
list.remove("hey");

/* Before removal:
|---------|---------|---------|
|  "hey"  | "hello" | "howdy" |
|---------|---------|---------|

After removal:
|---------|---------|
| "hello" | "howdy" |
|---------|---------|
*/
```

## Check if set contains a value

To check if a set has (contains) a value, we use the `contains` method like so:

```java
list.contains("hey"); // returns boolean

/* List:
|---------|---------|---------|
|  "hey"  | "hello" | "howdy" |
|---------|---------|---------|

Therefore, list.contains("hey") == true
*/
```
