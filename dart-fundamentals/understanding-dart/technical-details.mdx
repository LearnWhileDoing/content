Wikipedia describes dart as "an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax." This probably sounds like gibberish, so let's make sure we understand it before we move on.

# **Object-oriented**

Object-oriented programming, often shortened to OOP, is a term that is used to describe languages that support the concept of "objects" in programming. **Objects can represent real things or objects, as well as abstract things.** For example, an object can represent a car, an animal, an error, a color, clothing items, etc. Objects contain data, known as properties, and can perform methods.

There are 4 pillars, or rules, of OOP:

1. Inheritance, the sharing of information
2. Abstraction, the hiding of information
3. Encapsulation, the grouping of information
4. Polymorphism, the redefining of information

Moreover, there are 3 qualities that make a language a pure OOP language.

1. Pre-defined types are objects
2. User-defined types are objects
3. Methods must be called on objects

These topics will be covered more in-depth in the advanced section.

{% hint style="info" %} Unlike Java, Dart is a *pure object-oriented language*, which means that it completely abides by the 7 main concepts of OOP. We will learn why in the primitive data types lesson. {% endhint %}

# **Class-based**

One of the defining characteristics of OOP languages are classes. **Objects are** ***instances*** **of a class.** Think of a class as a blueprint for creating classes—for example, when you buy a LEGO® construction set, the blueprint for creating the model is like a class, and the final product is an object.

# **Garbage-collected**

In programming, there is a concept known as memory. The more memory your program uses, the slower it will run, and the less efficient it will be. Dart, like most modern languages, manages the memory your program uses automatically through use of a *garbage collector*. It collects the memory used by objects that are no longer being used by the program, and opens that memory back up to the program.

Generally, memory management isn't that much of a concern with a garbage collector, but if your program becomes very large or *memory-intensive*, you should consider what parts of your program is running slow and refactor (rethink) that code.

# **C-style syntax**

C is a language developed almost 50 years ago but is still in use today! Designed and developed by [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie), C is a very influential language, and it has shaped and defined modern programming. Much of the syntax, or coding style, of the Dart programming language was inspired by that of C. Many concepts in Dart like primitive types, methods, and top-level functions were popularized by C.

# Event loop

Dart implements what is called an *event loop* that controls the operation of your Dart program. To learn more about this concept, we'll use a video made by the official Flutter team at Google which explain the event loop in depth. We will use more videos from them later!

If this video seems a little advanced or daunting at first, don't worry! As long as you grasp a high-level understanding of how a Dart program operates, you are all set :)
