<Callout warning>

If you have an administered system, your administrator should have already performed these steps! Otherwise, you'll need to get into contact with them to do so.

In order to use Flutter, we first have to install it onto our computers. You will need to have VS Code open for this.

# Downloading and Installing

<Callout>

Note that these directions assume you are using macOS. If you are using Windows or Linux, follow the [official directions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows).

</Callout>

- [Download Flutter](https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra/releases/stable/macos/flutter_macos_1.22.4-stable.zip). It'll take a while to download because it's a pretty large file.
- Unzip the file you just downloaded like you did with VS Code. A new folder called "flutter" should be created. Make sure it's in your Downloads folder.

Now, you'll need to have VS Code open.

- In the menu bar, go to Terminal, then select New Terminal.
- Type the following commands and hit enter after each one:
    - `cd ~/Downloads`
    - `mv flutter ~/flutter`
        - (this one might take a while)
    - `code ~/.zshrc`
- A new window should open in VS Code. This is a *text editing* window.
- Scroll to the bottom of the file and make a new line (hit the enter button). Then, type:
    - `export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/flutter/bin"`
- Return back to the terminal and enter the following commands:
    - `source ./zshrc`
    - `which flutter`

If you don't get a message that says "flutter not found", then congratulations, you've installed Flutter!
