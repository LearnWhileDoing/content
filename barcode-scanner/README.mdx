Hey there, and welcome to Learn While Doing's **Flutter Barcode Scanner** course. In this course, you will learn about what it means to be an app developer, hybrid app development, the Dart programming language, and the Flutter framework.

Once we have covered the baseline of what you need to know about programming and app development, we will begin to apply our knowledge to create our own project. The project you will be creating in this course is an app that scans barcodes and presents the user with the barcode it scanned.

# Prerequisites

This course builds off of knowledge of the Dart programming language. It is recommended that you complete the Programming in Dart basic module before you begin this course. If you are confident in your Dart skills, then feel free to skip this prerequisite.
