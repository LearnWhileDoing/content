**Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.**

This is how Flutter describes itself. In essence, Flutter is **a way for us to build apps for multiple platforms and devices using one coding language: Dart**.

# Benefits

Flutter lists 3 main benefits that it provides. We'll look into what each of the benefits are, what they mean, and how we can use them to our... benefit!

## Fast Development

> Flutter's hot reload helps you quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bugs faster. Experience sub-second reload times without losing state on emulators, simulators, and hardware.

Flutter has a very useful feature called "hot reload." It lets you run your app on your phone, make updates to the code, and instantly see the changes on your device! It lets you make changes more easily and more efficiently.

## Expressive and Flexible UI

> Quickly ship features with a focus on native end-user experiences. Layered architecture allows for full customization, which results in incredibly fast rendering and expressive and flexible designs.

Flutter is great for helping us to create beautiful UIs, which stands for user interface. The UI is what your user will see on their screen while using the app. Flutter provides us with most of the styling already built-in, but it also allows us to customize our app as much as we want. This helps to create apps that not only act very fast, but look really good too!

You might come across, or maybe you have already heard of, a term similar to UI. That term would be UX, and it stands for user experience. While user interface is the actual design and look of your app, the user experience is how easy it is to use. For example, your app might look cool and have a great UI, but if it takes too many buttons to accomplish a simple task, that's bad UX design.

## Native Performance

> Flutter’s widgets incorporate all critical platform differences such as scrolling, navigation, icons and fonts to provide full native performance on both iOS and Android.

As we previously discussed, native performance will make your app more pleasing to your end user as it looks much more polished. Flutter lets you achieve native performance on all platforms without coding in the native programming languages.

# SDK & Framework

Flutter is both an SDK and a development framework:

- **SDK (standard/software development kit):** a set, or a kit, of tools and utilities to use in your code that will help you program for a specific use case.
- **Framework:** a collection of *elements* that you can use to build your project. A framework is like all of the parts you need to build something, but it's up to you as to how you put them together.

How do these terms apply to Flutter?

Flutter is an SDK that allows you to program for specific native platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) without using their native programming languages. Recall that Flutter uses Dart; iOS apps use Swift, and Android uses Java. In addition to allowing you to use Dart, Flutter also gives you ways to interact with the device you are programming your apps for. This includes access to the microphone, to speakers, to vibrations, to sensors, and to the camera (as we will use in this project).

Flutter is also a framework for app development. That means that it gives you elements like buttons, inputs, texts, icons, etc. that you can use to create your app. Without this, you would have to style your entire app from scratch, which is quite a hassle. This allows you to quickly made apps that look really good on all devices. However, another great part of Flutter is that you can customize and style each element as much as you want!
