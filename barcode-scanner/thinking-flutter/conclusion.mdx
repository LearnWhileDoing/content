In this section, we got a solid grasp on what exactly Flutter is, what it does, and how it helps us as app developers. We then reviewed some common practices and approaches that developers use with Flutter.

If you don't feel comfortable that you understand everything that you've learned, you can take a look at the [official Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs). Their documentation pages are more technical and complex than what was described in this tutorial, but they go more in-depth into these topics which may help you come to a better understanding.

Once you feel comfortable starting to code with Flutter and actually make apps, move onto the next section.
